subclass for MIA to saw and load from tiles.artsmia.org
  only ask for 'MIA' attribution if `artsmia` isn't somewhere in the URL?
  pseudocode: miaMap('object/image id', 'div')
    should take care of sawing the tile if it's not available, reading the image dimensions from the tilejson, building the ap and adding the layer.
    loading messages too? Could those go into the attribution?
tests
rubber band physics
  don't let image get too far out-of-bounds
    fire an event when image is dragged to the edge
remove initial fitBounds animation
  {animate: false, reset: true} aren't working?
window.resize handler: keep visible region?
  I don't like the zoomers resetting to 'full image visible' when the window changes
  maybe only force a re-zoom when the window gets bigger than the displayed image? But then what about when it gets smaller…
  Maybe only force reset when the image hasn't yet been interacted with…
add a control to zoom all the way out?

module.exports, npm package?
check for images that are smaller than the container
